# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone and value your input and feedback. Here's how you can contribute:

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the project, please use the issue tracker to report it. Before creating a new issue, please check to ensure the issue hasn't already been reported. When reporting an issue, be as specific as possible, providing steps to reproduce the issue, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Configure upstream to sync your fork with the original repository.
2. **Install the required pre-commit hooks** after cloning. This will ensures that all your changes are checked upon locally committing code.
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes. Keep your changes as focused as possible; if there are multiple unrelated changes you would like to make, please create multiple pull requests.
4. **Commit your changes**. Write a good commit message that explains what your changes do and why.
5. **Fix all pre-commit issues** This step is crucial as it ensures your changes meet our coding standards and tests pass. If you skip this step, the checks on your pull request may fail.
5. **Test your changes** to ensure they don't break existing functionality and that new features work as expected.
6. **Submit a pull request**. Provide a detailed description of the changes and reference any related issue numbers.
