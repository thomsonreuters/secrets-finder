The following EC2 instance has been running for more than ${limit} hours: [{{host.name}}](https://${aws_region}.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=${aws_region}#InstanceDetails:instanceId={{host.name}})

<br/>

Please terminate the EC2 instance from the AWS console or using the AWS CLI if no active scan is running to avoid unnecessary costs.

<br />

If the scanning phase is not progressing, you may want to gracefully terminate TruffleHog and manually send the results of the scan to the S3 bucket before terminating the instance.
